                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
                    <li>End-to-end encryption with 2048-bit RSA keys</li>
                    <li>No access to message contents or private keys</li>

                    <li>Complete user control over encryption keys and data</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mt-3">
                    Your messages are encrypted on your device before transmission and can only be decrypted by the intended recipient. We do not collect or store any personally identifiable information beyond your username.
                </p>
                
                <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-4">3. Account Creation and Security</h2>
                <p>

                    You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your credentials and must notify us of any unauthorized access to your account.
                </p>
                
                <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-4">4. Encryption Key Management</h2>
                <p>
                    PrivMsg enforces strict encryption policies:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
                    <li>Your private key is never stored on our servers.</li>
                    <li>We only store your public key to allow message encryption.</li>
                    <li>You are responsible for backing up and securing your private key.</li>
                    <li>If you lose your private key, we cannot recover your messages.</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="mt-3">
                    Any lawful request for data will be constrained by our minimal data collection and encryption-first architecture.
                </p>
